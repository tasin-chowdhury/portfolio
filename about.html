                <p class="">I am a Front-end Developer with 12 years commercial experience, author of CSS3
                    Foundations,
                    and graduate of Internet Technology. I create successful websites that are fast, easy to use, and
                    built
                    with
                    best practices.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="about-p">
                <p>I work to make a better web; one that is fast, easy to use, beautiful, accessible to all, and
                    frustration-free. Regardless of your specific business requirements, in solving these challenges,
                    you
                    have a great chance of finding success online.</p>
                <p>My main experience is in front-end development but I also have a passion for design. Given that
                    producing
                    a modern website requires the combination of design, server technology, and the layer that users
                    interacts with, I believe having experience in both design and development allows for making the
                    most
                    optimal user experiences.</p>
                <p>My clients have found that hiring me has saved them time and money, made it easier to grow their
                    website
                    alongside their business, and made for a product that is consistently of high quality.</p>
            </div>
        </header>
        <section class="about-frontend-developer">
            <h1 class="heading">Front-end Developer</h1>
            <p>
                I use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to produce responsive websites and web apps that provide users the best
                and most appropriate experience suited to their device and browser. <br><br>
            </p>
            <div class="aside-part">
                <p>
                    I write standards based code that is semantic, accessible, search-engine friendly, easy to maintain,
                    cross
                    browser compatible, and performant. <br><br>
                    Building a future-proof and easy-to-maintain website is achieved by breaking down a web page into
                    its
                    smallest pieces, often called components, and building them in a way that exists outside the context
                    of
                    the design they first appear in. This allows for components that can be re-used in other areas of a
                    website as it grows and makes the intention easier for other developers to understand and test.
                    Wherever
                    possible, I find it valuable to create a style guide (using Storybook for example) that acts as a
                    document for a reusable and maintainable code base. All involved in a project can rely on a style
                    guide
                    to understand a projectâ€™s language and produce a more consistent user experience. Re-usable
                    components
                    make for a website that can quickly grow as does your business.
